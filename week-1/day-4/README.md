# Vets In Tech Web Development Course

## Week 1 Day 4

### Warm Up [10 minutes]

At this point, if you're reading this in your editor, you have successfully perform a git pull!

Be comfortable with this, as this will be a frequent practice.

1. All work will be done in `warm-up.html & warm-up.css`
2. Build the HTML template (Hint: Use the VS Code Extension!)
3. Inside of the body, create 3 separate (not within one another) `div` with background-color in-line styling as followed:
   1. RGB of 160, 75, 49
   2. Hex Code of 27CCD2
   3. blue
4. If you update your browser, you shouldn't see anything! `div` is sized according to its content! So let's add a `h1` with the text `REDBLUEGREEN` to the first one, `h2` with the text `16 Base Hexadecimal` to the second and `h3` with the text `Common Name` for the third.
5. Inside of `warm-up.css`, using CSS, style `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` accordingly:
   1. lowercase
   2. right aligned
   3. font size of 58 pixels

Finished Early?

1. Add colors of your choice to each of the text!
2. Pull in a new font from google & apply it to `h1`

Having Trouble?

1. Did you use the `style` attribute within the opening tag for your in-line styles?
2. Did you `<link>` your CSS file to your `warm-up.html`?
